## Installation Guide 🖥️
Installing Hephaestus is a simple process. Currently Hephaestus doesnt have dedicated hosting so you will need to host it on your system. 
If you want external hosting I personally use Heroku which works like magic. Takes a bit of setting up but it does the job.

##### Step 1
First clone Hephaestus onto your system and run `npm init` which sets up the NPM Environment for Hephaestus.
##### Step 2
Next run `npm install` to install all of the dependencies which Hephaestus uses. 
##### Step 3
For security reasons, I have not pushed the .env file to this repo. You will need to create one. and structure it as follows
```
TOKEN = YOUR_BOT_TOKEN
OWNER_ID = YOUR_USER_ID
PREFIX = COMMAND PREFIX
YOUTUBE_KEY = YOUTUBE_API_KEY
GENIUS_KEY = YOUR_GENIUS_ACCESS_TOKEN
```
You will need to setup a Youtube Data API V3 Connection as well as start a GeniusAPI Connection. Hephaestus handles the technical implementation of these APIs so all you need to do is put your API Credentials into the Env and Hephaestus will take it from there.

##### Step 4
Once you have completed the above steps then Hephaestus will be able to run on your server. 
If you have any questions that you couldnt find answers to on Google. Please add me on Discord. My username is at the bottom of this page.

## Music Player 🎼
The music playing functionality for Hephaestus requires an interaction between your client and the YoutubeAPI. This is so the bot can get information on specific videos and play them successfully

The implementation of the music features require access to the Youtube Data API V3.

As of Hephaestus V1.6, a Lyric command has been added. This takes in the arguments of artist and title of song and will send the lyrics of the song to current message channel. Support for interaction with the music player is currently limited as searching Genius using the Video title could sometimes prove ambiguous with the song or Genius couldnt detect the song due to YouTube titles including Official Music Video etc.

Currently the music player is limited to YouTube songs only since the Spotify API and DiscordJS have conflicts when playing spotify songs by their URL. I may add this functionality later by converting playlists to their youtube equivalents.

## Moderation 🔨
This bot has some moderation features. With time will come further updates expanding Hephaestus' capabilities in managing your Discord Server but right now, Hephaestus, has support for kicking and banning aswell as role management.

To use the moderation features you need to __mention__ the user and/or role you wish to operate on

## Dynamic Implementation of Commands
The most useful implementation which I have made with Hephaestus is my dynamic commands and their command handler.

As you can see from the directory, the main `bot.js` file is accompanied by a `commands folder`. Every Javascript file in the commands folder and the subsequent subdirectories are a separate command and the main command handler in the `Handlers/CommandHandler.js` file iterates through these folders adding each command and its name to a map within the `client` class.

The additions of seperate handlers for Commands and Events has made Hephaestus a more maintainable and easier to understand bot as the number of lines per file is minimal. Furthermore this has aided in the development as I can instantly identify where errors are coming up.

```javascript

//Function to load commands
async function load_command_from_directory(command_category) {
    fs.readdir(`./commands/${command_category}`, (err, files) => {
        if (err) return console.error(err);
        files.forEach(file => {
            if (!file.endsWith('.js')) return;
            let adminCommands = require(`./commands/${command_category}/${file}`);
            //console.log(`ATTEMPTING TO LOAD: ${adminCommands.name} `);
            client.commands.set(adminCommands.name, adminCommands);
        });
    });
}


```

The command handler then proceeds on to use a try/catch statement in order to attempt the execution whilst providing informative error handling to the Terminal and End User upon an error

```javascript
107 - try {
108 -     command.execute(message, args);
109 - } catch (error) {
110 -    console.error(error);
111 -    message.reply('there was an error trying to execute that command!');
112 - }
```

## Adding more commands
Before adding more commands, I recommend you read through the [DiscordJS Documentation](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) and the [DiscordJS Dev Guide](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin).

The Dynamic Command handler on Hephaestus means that the implementation and addition of new commands is automatic and simple. 
Simply create a new file in the format `YOUR_COMMAND.js` under the `commands` directory. The JavaScript file needs to be layed out as follows 
 ```javascript
module.exports = {
    name: STRING '', 
    description: STRING, 
    aliases: ARRAY [],
    cooldown: INT, 
    usage: <prefix><command name><args>,
    execute(message, args) { 
        //Code for the command
    }
};
```

Once you have created the js file as shown above you can start developing your desired command. 
Below is a fully worked example using the above template for the `!ping` command.

```javascript
const Discord = require('discord.js');
var maintenance = false;
module.exports = {
    name: 'ping',
    description: 'Ping!',
    aliases: ['pi'],
    execute(message, args) {
        message.channel.send("Pinging...") //Placeholder for ping
            .then((msg) => {
                msg.edit("Ping: " + (Date.now() - msg.createdTimestamp))
            });
    }
};
```
